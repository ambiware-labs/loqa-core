# Loqa Core

The core runtime, control plane, SDKs, documentation, and protocol schemas for Loqa - a local-first, open-core ambient intelligence platform.

## Overview

Loqa Core contains the foundational components for building and running a distributed, privacy-first AI system on local hardware. This monorepo includes:

- **Runtime**: Core execution engine for orchestrating AI services
- **Control Plane**: Service discovery, load balancing, and cluster management
- **SDKs**: Client libraries for various languages
- **Documentation**: Technical docs and API references
- **Proto Schemas**: Protocol definitions for inter-service communication

## Getting Started

*Coming soon - initial implementation in progress*

## Architecture

Loqa is designed as a modular, distributed system that can scale across multiple local nodes:

- Speech-to-Text (STT) services
- Large Language Model (LLM) inference
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) services
- Skill execution and plugin management
- Message bus for inter-service communication
